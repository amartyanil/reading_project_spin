# Reading Project, Summer 2024, IACS

This is some tinkering that I did with the SPIN Model Checker in the Summer of 2024 while I was doing a Reading Project under Dr. Rajarshi Ray.

While I did explore the syntax of SPIN to some extent, as a learning assignment I tried to model the Peterson's algorithm for two processes.
