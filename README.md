# Reading Project, Summer 2024, IACS

This is some tinkering that I did with the SPIN Model Checker in the Summer of 2024 while I was doing a Reading Project under Dr. Rajarshi Ray.

Here, I tried to model the Peterson's algorithm for 2 processes.

## How to open this, provided you have SPIN installed

1. Navigate to the place where the `.pml` is there
2. On the terminal, execute the command `spin peterson.pml`
